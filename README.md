# Hotel Reservations Software.
### The compiler used to run this software is "gcc (Debian 10.3.0-9) 10.3.0"
Only standard C Libraries have been used to develop this software.<br><br>
After you download the software you have to compile the main file to be able to run it.<br>
To do so run the following command:
```
gcc path_to/gastgeber.c -o gastgeber
```
If compiling will be success run the executable with the  **init**  argument to create the databases.
```
path_to/gastgeber init
```
If you don't see any errors software is ready for use.

# Enjoy...
